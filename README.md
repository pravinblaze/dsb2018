This project implements a Faster RCNN like RPN and a U-Net like segmentation network.

Software requirements:

python
pytorch
torchvision
matplotlib
pandas
opencv
numpy
PIL

Hardware requirements:

I have used a GTX 1050TI GPU for this project.
Using a GPU is highly recommended as it might take many hours to train the models just using a CPU.

For instructions on initial setup, dowonloading the dataset and executing code,
Plese follow the python notebook (notebook.ipynb) in the source folder.
